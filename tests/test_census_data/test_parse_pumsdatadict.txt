Note for both Industry and Occupation lists in Data Dictionary:

*  In cases where the SOC occupation code ends in X(s) or Y(s), two or more 
   SOC occupation codes were aggregated to correspond to a specific Census 
   occupation code. In these cases, the Census occupation description is used 
   for the SOC occupation title.

** These codes are pseudo codes developed by the Census Bureau and are not
   official or equivalent NAICS or SOC codes.
